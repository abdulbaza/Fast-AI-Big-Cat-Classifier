# Fast-AI-Big-Cat-Classifier
This classifier is build using the bear classifier in this notedbook: https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/02_production.ipynb 

The network used is a CNN with 18 deep layers details of which can be found here: https://docs.fast.ai/vision.models.xresnet.html


The linked fastbook tutorial details the procedure to create the classifier using jupyter notebooks 
The bing image search API was used as a way to get data for training and validating this model. 


Instead of bears I tried to use the keyword "panthera" which is the genus that includes all big cats. 
In this model my fine tuned features were jaguars, lions, and tigers
